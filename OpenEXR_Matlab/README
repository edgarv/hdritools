This directory contains two simple mex plugins for EXR image read/write in Matlab. 
EXR is an image format for high dynamic range image. More information about it can 
be found at OpenEXR website.


To install these two plugins, you need to first install OpenEXR library (version 1.2.2 or above). 
Then in Matlab 7.0.1 or above:

>> compile_exrio

Make sure your MEX setup uses the VC7.1 compiler or above instead of VC6. 
Also change the pathname in compile_exrio.m to the path you installed OpenEXR library.

After these setting and compiling, you should now have exrread.dll and exrwrite.dll 
(in Matlab 7.1 or above, the output is exrread.mexw32 and exrwrite.mexw32). 
Now you could use them as common Matlab functions. For example,

>> a = exrread('norm_btf_009_12.exr');

>> size(a)

ans =

   512   512     3

>> max(a(:))

ans =

    2.9297

>> min(a(:))

ans =

    0.3069

>> a=100*rand(300,300,3);
>> size(a)

ans =

   300   300     3

>> exrwrite(a,'a.exr');
